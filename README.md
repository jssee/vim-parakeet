# 🦜 vim-parakeet
A light and airy colorscheme for vim and neovim.

## Installation
you can install the colorscheme using whatever package/plugin manager you want,
here is an example using [minpac](https://github.com/k-takata/minpac)

```vim
call minpac#add('jssee/vim-parakeet')
```

```vim
set termguicolors " for best results
colorscheme parakeet
```

## Acknowledgements
This colorscheme is heavily based on the wonderful [stellarized
light](https://github.com/nightsense/stellarized) theme by @nightsense. It has
always been a favorite of mine and the purpose of `parakeet` is to extend what
they started.
